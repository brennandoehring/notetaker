  ## Description 
  This note taking application allows you to read, create, save, edit, and delete notes on the server side. It uses Express for I/O and Heroku for deployment. 

  ## Installation
  With Node.js, Express.js, and Visual Studio Code installed, open the repo folders in VSC. Open the console and run "node server.js". This will initiate the server. From there, open localhost://3000 in your web browser, and you will have access to the application.

  ## Usage
  This project will allow users to create, edit, save, and delete notes without having to use only their local machine. With all data serverside, a user may access it from any device.
